[Intro: Mina]
Like candy sugar, so sweet
That's what it tastes like when you're lovin' me

[Verse 1: Momo, Tzuyu]
Thinking 'bout you every night, I
I can't get enough
And whenever I let you out of my sight, I
I start to crave it too much

[Pre-Chorus: Jeongyeon, Dahyun]
There's something 'bout your love, it keeps me up
And the rush goes straight to my brain
No, baby, I don't wanna come unstuck
Don't wanna let the high go to waste, ah

[Chorus: Sana, Jihyo]
Like candy sugar, so sweet
That's what it tastes like when you're lovin' me
'Cause baby, when we're moving our feet
You got me right where I wanna be

[Post-Chorus: All]
Candy sugar, so sweet, darling
Candy sugar, so sweet
Oh, you're like
Candy sugar, so sweet, darling
Candy sugar, so sweet

[Verse 2: Chaeyoung, Nayeon]
Honey, you know the way to my heart
Like strawberry lemon on ice
Every sip feels like I'm back at the start, I
I, I need it tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Tzuyu, Dahyun]
There's something 'bout your love, it keeps me up
And the rush goes straight to my brain
No, baby, I don't wanna come unstuck
Don't wanna let the high go to waste, ah

[Chorus: Mina, Nayeon]
Like candy sugar, so sweet
That's what it tastes like when you're lovin' me
'Cause baby, when we're moving our feet
You got me right where I wanna be

[Post-Chorus: All]
Candy sugar, so sweet, darling
Candy sugar, so sweet
Oh, you're like
Candy sugar, so sweet, darling
Candy sugar, so sweet

[Bridge: Mina, Nayeon]
Like candy sugar, so sweet
That's what it tastes like when you're lovin' me
Baby, when we're moving our feet
You got me right where I wanna be, be, be, oh yeah

[Chorus: Sana, Jihyo, Nayeon]
Like candy sugar, so sweet (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's what it tastes like when you're lovin' me (Oh no, no)
'Cause baby, when we're moving our feet (Ooh)
You got me right where I wanna be (Oh yeah)

[Post-Chorus: All, Jihyo]
Candy sugar, so sweet, darling
Candy sugar, so sweet (Candy sugar, baby)
Oh, you're like
Candy sugar, so sweet, darling
Candy sugar, so sweet
