[Verse 1: Tzuyu, Sana, Mina, Dahyun]
Someday, we will come to pass
And someday, I will have to let you go
でも終わりじゃない
想い出は溢れるほど
Got our hearts tied up so closely together
But they're gonna part
For now, we are staying here
And I've been thinking, now I really know

[Chorus: Nayeon, Chaeyoung, Jihyo, Momo]
Know there will come a time
For a bittersweet salute (I wanna)
Stay in this moment now
But we don't get to choose
'Cause we're drifting away (Hey), but don't be afraid (Hey)
We'll meet at lost and found (No matter)
What our love becomes
The two of us will always be likе one

[Post-Chorus]
(Hey, hey)

[Verse 2: Jeongyeon, Mina, Sana, Dahyun, (Momo, Tzuyu)]
Bad thoughts playing with my hеad
I'm feeling how they're driving me insane
I wish I could be like Peter Pan
No growing up, no need to pick a lane
Ain't got the luck, but we do got the passion
We're going down, but we're strong and robust
So let's forget everything tonight
Now, I know (Yeah, I know everything I need to know, tell ya)

[Chorus: Jihyo, Jeongyeon, Nayeon, Chaeyoung]
Know there will come a time
For a bittersweet salute (I wanna)
Stay in this moment now
But we don't get to choose
'Cause we're drifting away (Hey), but don't be afraid (Hey)
We'll meet at lost and found (No matter)
What our love becomes
The two of us will always be like one

[Bridge]
We're like a pretty piece of art
'Til we have a change of heart
We don't have to worry though
Gonna get, gonna get, gonna get
A sign to tell us, yes or no?
But I bet, but I bet, but I bet
We've gotta trust in each other
And just play along like it's alright
With you, I've still got butterflies
Okay, let's roll the dice
We know, 限られた
時間と変わらぬ our fate
(We coexist in harmony, stop and rewind)
I wouldn't dare to miss out on you, I tell ya

[Chorus: Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Jihyo, Momo]
Know there will come a time
For a bittersweet salute (I wanna)
Stay in this moment now
But we don't get to choose
'Cause we're drifting away (Hey), but don't be afraid (Hey)
We'll meet at lost and found (No matter)
What our love becomes
The two of us will always be like one

[Outro: Mina, Tzuyu, Nayeon, Jihyo]
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Yeah, always be like one
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
We will always be like one
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
We will always be like one
Stay in this moment now
The two of us will always be like one
